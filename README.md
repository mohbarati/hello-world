# hello-world
This is my first Repository on GitHub!
I'm just an enthusiast who happen to discover programming world at the age of 28.
Hope it's not too late to start participating in this realm and hope i can make 
some progress in finding an acceptable answer to my questions about the way brain works.
Cheers!
